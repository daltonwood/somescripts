This script copies Firefox Simple Tab Groups backups to a peer-synced folder in my home directory. Once the backups are copied the script will delete any backups older than 45 days from the user downloads folder, and any backups older than 60 days from the target folder.

I set this up as a launch agent running every 30 minutes.

***wanna use this script?***
- replace cpDIR with your target folder

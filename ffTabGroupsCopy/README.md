This script copies my Firefox Simple Tab Groups backups from my work laptop Downloads folder to a peer-synced folder in my home directory. Once the backup folders are copied the script will delete any backups older than 45 days from the synced folder and Downloads.

I have this set up as a LaunchAgent running every 30 minutes on my laptop to ensure the latest tabs are available on any of my computers, using SyncThing.

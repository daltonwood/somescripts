**Quick Disclaimer**

Nothing is 100% original! We know this. Consider this repo my quiver of useful scripts that I have either written entirely myself, or copied, pasted, cobbled together using Stack Overflow and the like. There are many scripts like these out in the world, I am not inventing anything new here. I will always cite work and ideas that are not my own.
